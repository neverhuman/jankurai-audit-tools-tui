# Agent exceptions and overrides

This document defines the agent-friendly exception pattern for jankurai-tools-tui:
how an agent or maintainer requests, records, and bounds an override of a
standard rule. Exceptions are the only sanctioned way to deviate from the audit
baseline.

## Principle

The default answer is "follow the standard." An exception is a dated, owned,
expiring waiver for a specific rule on a specific path. Exceptions are data, not
prose: they live next to the code they govern and are reviewed on every audit.

## How to request an exception

1. Identify the exact `rule_id` and `path` the exception applies to (from the
   audit JSON `findings[]`).
2. Add an entry to the relevant `agent/*.toml` manifest. For boundary
   reclassifications use `agent/boundaries.toml`; for scan scope use the
   `[scan]` block of `agent/audit-policy.toml`.
3. Every exception entry MUST carry:
   - `owner` — the team or person accountable.
   - `classification` — e.g. `brownfield`, `temporary`, `vendor`.
   - `expires` — an ISO date after which the exception is invalid and the audit
     fails again.
   - `migration_path` — the concrete plan to remove the exception.

## Example

A bundled font asset under `crates/tuiwright/assets/` is vendored, not authored.
It can be recorded as a dated, owned waiver:

```toml
[[asset_exception]]
path = "crates/tuiwright/assets/JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf"
classification = "vendor"
owner = "tools"
expires = "2026-12-31"
migration_path = "Keep the font vendored behind the render module; revisit if a system-font fallback lands."
```

## Override review

- Every exception is re-evaluated on each `just audit` run.
- An expired exception is treated as a hard finding, not a pass.
- Removing an exception requires deleting its entry and proving the underlying
  rule now passes on its own.

## What is never excepted

Secret leakage, destructive migrations without rollback, and hand-edits to
generated zones are never granted exceptions. Fix the underlying cause instead.
